	"bans": {
		"Aer'dak": ["It's very easy with effects like Xelfe and Bi-Mowercycle to give 4-6 of your opponent's creatures range. Letting you win the game for 10 Mugic Counters. At most, this can take a couple of combats to happen, but some variants can win before the first combat."],
		"Bodal, Flamedrill Researcher": ["Mostly due to his Expend Earth ability. There are a couple scary things but the most potent is an combo involving Olkiex, the Scouts Monocular, Fluidmorph and Destructazooka.\nThis will let you bring back a Battlegear every attack. Droskin is the most abusable."],
		"Bi-Mowercycle": ["This card is very meta warping, there are very few Battlegear that can go on support creatures and Bi-Mowercycle is the most consistently good. Bi-Mowercycle allows you to give any Creature Range and Swift without hindering their Battlegear choice. This results in it appearing in a lot of decks which means you almost always need to include Defender."],
		"Dror'niq": ["His first ability is too powerful. He can deal 10 damage for 1 Mugic Counter, and when he's stored up enough counters, he can one-shot opposing engaged Creatures.\nHis second ability is no slouch either. Although it takes 4 Mugic Counters, it can easily add up to 30-50 damage that can be used on any creature."],
		"Hive Amber": ["See Hive Unsung"],
		"Hive Unsung": ["When combined with Ramarhvir the Hivebringer, it enables Danains resurrection to be too efficiently and making it very difficult to beat (the game drags on). Hive Unsung can also be used in an infinite combo to allow a one turn win."],
		"Imaginary Walls": ["Reducing 10 damage per attack is strong. Even a modest energy M'arrillian or Minion could be able to take 4 or more attacks than usual because of the reduction.\nReturning a Mugic is not a sufficient benefit for the opposing player to counter act the more difficult battle."],
		"Lord Van Bloot, Servant of Aa'unne": ["Element Attacks are close to half the Attacks in the game, and having a whole deck built around them is common. Other cards remove elements, but Bloot's preventing element gain clause means element decks lose without high courage."],
		"Melody of the Meek": ["Taking only 10 damage from every source is brutal. Even with only 30 energy this card would be a big advantage.\nBut there's tons of effects Creatures gain energy - making it difficult to kill a Creature using this Mugic."],
		"Najarin, Fluidmorphers Foe": ["Plenty of card like Heptagon Hail, Chimegrid and Baladeer's Flute allow Najarin to get a plenty of Mugic Counters. Then being able to spend these Counters to give Creatures Energy is strong. This becomes worse When fighting a deck that gains Mugic Counters such as Fluidmorphers.\nBut if that's not bad enough, he shuts down any M'arrillian deck with a built in Refrain of Denial."],
		"Najarin's Tower of Song": ["Like Tonal Destruction, this card can be abused by Enre-hep to reduce or destroy your opponent's hand. It's an expensive Mugic that doesn't see play where it isn't abused."],
		"Primal Smash": ["A look at other Attacks shows that 20 Damage for 1 Build Point with no condition is far above the curve. Because of this, most decks contain it."],
		"Rao'pa Sahkk, Condensation Ceremony": ["Easily shuts down Mipedian and UnderWorld decks. And hinders many support Creatures in OverWorld and Danian tribes. Being unable to play Mugic or Abilities is backbreaking.\nAt least Fluidmorphers are having fun at the beach."],
		"Super Cooled Rain": ["Removing 4 Mugic Counters from Creatures is a blow to most decks. Aside from a couple of cards that negate attacks, its not preventable. To add, with Water this attack deals 40 Damage. Combine with *Vial of Liquid Thought* or other Attack cycling."],
		"Tartarek, Psi Overloader": ["On his own a very playable card, two Elements, two very good Disciplines, good Energy and two Mugic Counters.\nOn top of an already good card, his effect lets you destroy Chieftains with ease.", "Tartarek has Warbeast-like stats but no Recklessness, two Elements, two Mugicians, and a decent Wisdom increasing Ability, and can easily destroy a play style (goodbye Chieftains). To add insult to injury, Tartarek's Brainwashed ability is the same. His ability is the perfect cover. Who would suspect a guy whose abilities never change?"],
		"Tonal Destruction" : ["This card is decent if you just want to limit your opponent. But gets out of hand when combined with Enre-hep High Muge or Lore High Muge by allowing you to strip all the Mugic from your opponent's hand."],
		"Zamool, Lord Van Bloot's Enforcer": ["Do you hate your opponent?\nOr do you just want the UnderWorld to take over Perim?", "Sometimes I like playing Solitaire when I'm bored. But Solitaire doesn't require an opponent to play.", "I got bored of playing Chess against myself, so I decided to to play Chaotic against myself.", "I heard you wanted to move past Advanced Apprentice rules, but weren't quite ready for the challenge.", "Being unable to play Mugic or Abilities while your opponent still can is unfair. Getting that consistently is unplayable.", "With Zamool's help, Lord Van Bloot will finally conquer Chaor!"]

	"watchlist": {
		"Enre-Hep, High Muge of the Desert": ["He has ability to copy Mugics (and commonly 6 times), combined with a caster equipped with Hepptad's Crown, you can cast any Mugic many times, causing oppresive or broken outcomes. "]
	},
	"joke": {
		"Agame": ["He's banned for atempting to use fan sets."],
		"Afjak": ["Attempting to ban the judge with the highest level of understanding in the game would result in Chaotic truly becoming chaotic. As everyone interprets the rules their own way, blatant cheating overruns what remains of the community until no one wishes to play and the game subsides into oblivion."],
		"Maxxor's Torch": ["One hit of this can send any amphibious creature the Shadow Realm. Oops I mean it hits the code out of M'arrillians."],
		"Ixxik": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE_TUwYc6Vk"],
		"Ursis": ["A divisive card. High stats, one stat, no ability (but no negative either), 3 Mugic counters and most importantly Creature type Muge."],
		"Marksman's Preparation": ["This card has been talked about for similar reasons to Primal Smash. You can treat it as a 2 Build Point attack that deals 30 Damage and helps you cycle and a 0 Cost that deals 0 Damage and clogs your hand until you draw the other. Despite the downside, its a strong burst of damage and cycling effect for low Build Points."],
		"Xerium Armor": ["Against the typical opponent, this Battlegear makes them unable to play their best attacks to maximum damage against big damage decks (like Strike or Element X). With a high Energy Creature, it takes a long time to defeat it.\nThe downsides are it isn't effective against match-ups which do consistent 15-20 Damage attacks, and Battlegear removal/flipping abilities keep it in check."]
